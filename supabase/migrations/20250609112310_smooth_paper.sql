  # Create missing tables and policies

  1. New Tables
    - `students`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `parent_id` (uuid, foreign key to user_profiles)
      - `full_name` (text)
      - `grade_level` (text)
      - `current_level` (enum)
      - `plan_type` (enum)
      - `goals` (text, nullable)
      - `notes` (text, nullable)
      - `created_at` (timestamp)
      - `updated_at` (timestamp)
    
    - `bookings`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `student_id` (uuid, foreign key to students)
      - `teacher_id` (uuid, foreign key to user_profiles, nullable)
      - `booking_type` (enum)
      - `scheduled_date` (timestamp)
      - `duration_minutes` (integer)
      - `status` (enum)
      - `notes` (text, nullable)
      - `created_at` (timestamp)
      - `updated_at` (timestamp)

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on both tables
    - Add policies for students (parents, students, admins)
    - Add policies for bookings (parents, students, teachers, admins)
